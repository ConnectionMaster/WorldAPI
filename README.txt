WHAT IS IT?

WorldAPI is a PHP consumer of the World API from Second Life.

SL's World API gives the aspiring web scraper a lot of info about Second Life residents, places, and groups.

WorldAPI (no space... see?) wraps all that up in a handy PHP object.

The Second Life World API documentation is here: https://wiki.secondlife.com/wiki/World_API

WorldAPI needs: cURL and DOM PHP extensions, and PHP 5 (since it's a set of classes).

HOW DO YOU USE IT?

The index.php file has some example usage.

HOW IS IT LICENSED?

It's happy and friendly and GNU licensed.

WHERE DOES IT LIVE?

The official repository for WorldAPI is on github. Of course, everyone's welcome to join in with bug reports and pull requests. https://github.com/SoloMornington/WorldAPI
